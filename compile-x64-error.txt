When building x64 project you might get following error from nvidia compiler:

1>  nvcc fatal   : Microsoft Visual Studio configuration file 'vcvars64.bat' could not be found for installation at 'C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0/VC/bin/x86_amd64/../../..'

It seems that batch file exists. It just is in wrong location and has wrong name :(

Needed file actually exists in:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\bin\x86_amd64\vcvarsx86_amd64.bat

So copy the file into:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\bin\amd64\vcvars64.bat

This might not be the best solution, but it worked for me :)
